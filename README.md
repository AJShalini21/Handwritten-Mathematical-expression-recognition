# Handwritten Arithmetic Expression Recognition

This project implements a complete system to recognize and evaluate handwritten arithmetic expressions in real time. It combines image preprocessing, symbol classification using deep learning, sequence recognition, expression parsing, and final computation.

## ðŸš€ Features

- End-to-end pipeline from image to evaluated result
- Symbol recognition using CNN, MobileNetV2, and ResNet
- Sequence modeling with contour detection and symbol classification
- Secure expression parsing and evaluation

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- **Basic CNN**: Lightweight, fast, moderate accuracy
- **MobileNetV2**: Efficient and accurate with low memory usage
- **ResNet**: Most accurate (~94.2%) but computationally intensive

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

- **Symbol recognition**: [Kaggle - Handwritten Math Symbols](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols)
- **Sequence data**: Custom handwritten expression images with annotated ground truth

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook for development
- Image processing: grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization, contour detection

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

- Classification Accuracy
- Loss Curves
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Expression Recognition Accuracy

## ðŸ“Œ Future Work

- Extend symbol support (e.g., exponents, roots)
- Improve generalization for diverse handwriting styles
- Optimize for deployment in educational tools
